\title{Two-sample Kernel Test using Rcpp acceleration}
\usage{
TS_twosample(
  data1,
  data4,
  tao,
  band,
  quant,
  alpha = 0.05,
  plot = TRUE,
  plot_genes = NULL,
  gene_names = NULL,
  condition_names = c("Condition 1", "Condition 2")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data1}{Sequence 1 (genes x bins matrix)}

\item{data4}{Sequence 2 (genes x bins matrix, same dimensions as data1)}

\item{tao}{Bias term (from est.c)}

\item{band}{Kernel bandwidth}

\item{quant}{Shrinkage variance (vector of 3 values)}

\item{alpha}{Significance level for hypothesis testing (default: 0.05)}

\item{plot}{Logical, whether to generate summary plots (default: FALSE)}

\item{plot_genes}{Integer vector of gene indices to plot in detail (default: NULL, plots first significant gene)}

\item{gene_names}{Optional character vector of gene names for plotting (default: NULL, uses indices)}

\item{condition_names}{Optional character vector of length 2 for condition names (default: c("Condition 1", "Condition 2"))}
}
\value{
List containing statistics, p-values, significant genes, and optionally plots
}
\description{
Compute a kernel-smoothed statistic for comparing two expression data from ChIPseq.
This function applies three kernel smoothing methods to each sample and compares
their distributions using a nonparametric statistic.

\examples{
\dontrun{
data(data1)
data(data4)
tao <- est.c(data1, data4)

# Basic usage
results <- TS_twosample(data1, data4, tao, band=180, quant=c(0.01,0.01,0.01))

# With visualization
results <- TS_twosample(data1, data4, tao, band=180, quant=c(0.01,0.01,0.01),
                        plot=TRUE, alpha=0.05)

# Plot specific genes with custom names
results <- TS_twosample(data1, data4, tao, band=180, quant=c(0.01,0.01,0.01),
                        plot=TRUE, plot_genes=c(1,3),
                        gene_names=c("GeneA","GeneB","GeneC","GeneD","GeneE"),
                        condition_names=c("Control", "Treatment"))
